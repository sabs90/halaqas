# Halaqas — Adoption & Outreach Plan

## Adoption Strategy Overview

Halaqas has no marketing budget and no revenue model. Adoption must be organic, driven by genuine community value. The strategy relies on three pillars: a high-value Ramadan launch, leveraging existing community networks, and designing for virality through WhatsApp sharing.

---

## Pre-Launch (4–6 weeks before Ramadan)

### Secure the Go Pray Endorsement

- **Who:** Your friend who built Go Pray
- **Ask:** Permission to use Go Pray's mosque database, and ideally an endorsement or cross-promotion ("From the community behind Go Pray" or a link from Go Pray's app/site)
- **Why it matters:** Instant credibility. Go Pray is trusted and established. Association removes the "who is behind this?" concern
- **Timing:** As early as possible — this shapes how you position and brand the launch

### Register Domain & Set Up Infrastructure

- Register halaqas.com (or halaqas.com.au)
- Set up Cloudflare, Supabase, and Groq accounts
- Deploy a simple "Coming soon for Ramadan" landing page to start building anticipation

### Collect Flyers for Top 20 Mosques

The initial seed content is critical. Target the 20 most prominent / active mosques in Sydney. Prioritise those with strong Ramadan programs.

**Suggested seed list (refine based on your knowledge):**

1. Lakemba Mosque (Imam Ali bin Abi Talib Mosque)
2. Auburn Gallipoli Mosque
3. Rooty Hill Mosque
4. Punchbowl Mosque (Al Zahra)
5. ISRA (Islamic Sciences & Research Academy) — Baulkham Hills
6. Masjid Al Noor — Granville
7. Liverpool Mosque
8. Bankstown Mosque
9. Campbelltown Mosque
10. Parramatta Mosque
11. Dee Why Mosque
12. IREA (Islamic Research and Educational Academy) — various locations
13. Al-Faisal College mosque events
14. Condell Park Mosque
15. Greenacre Mosque (Masjid Al Sunnah)
16. Chester Hill Mosque
17. Surry Hills — various community spaces
18. Blacktown Mosque
19. Arncliffe Mosque (Masjid Ibrahim)
20. Roselands / Wiley Park community mosques

**How to collect:** Follow mosque Facebook pages, join key WhatsApp groups, visit mosque websites, collect physical flyers if local. Start 2–3 weeks before Ramadan as mosques begin publishing their Ramadan programs.

### Soft Launch to Trusted Circle

- Share the site with 10–15 trusted friends and family members before public launch
- Ask for honest feedback on usability, especially the submission flow on mobile
- Fix critical issues before wider release

## Launch Week (Start of Ramadan)

### Personal Network Push

- Share Halaqas in your own WhatsApp groups with a brief, genuine message explaining what it is and why you built it
- Ask close friends to share in their networks
- Post on your personal social media if applicable

**Sample WhatsApp message:**

> Assalamu alaikum! Ramadan Mubarak 🌙
>
> I built a free website called Halaqas that shows you what events, talks, and classes are happening at mosques across Sydney this Ramadan — all in one place.
>
> Check it out: halaqas.com
>
> You can browse by area, subscribe to any mosque's calendar, and even submit events yourself if your mosque isn't listed yet. Please share with anyone who might find it useful!

### Mosque Community Engagement

- Reach out to mosque social media admins (Facebook/Instagram) and ask them to share
- Frame it as: "This will help more people attend your events. We've already listed your Ramadan program — here's the link to your mosque's page on Halaqas"
- Provide a ready-made social media post they can share
- Be respectful of the fact that it's a busy time — keep outreach brief and helpful, not demanding

### Go Pray Cross-Promotion (if endorsement secured)

- Post in Go Pray's community channels
- Request a mention on Go Pray's social media or in-app
- Frame as a complementary tool: "Go Pray shows you where to pray. Halaqas shows you what's on"

### Friday Sermon Timing

- The first Jumu'ah (Friday prayer) of Ramadan is a natural moment when people are thinking about their Ramadan plans
- Time your biggest outreach push for the Thursday or Friday of the first week of Ramadan

---

## During Ramadan (Ongoing)

### Monitor and Respond

- Check the admin queue daily for amendments and reports
- Fix any bugs or usability issues immediately — first impressions matter
- Monitor which mosques are getting the most views and which areas are underserved

### Encourage Submissions

- When people share the site in WhatsApp groups, the natural response will be "my mosque isn't listed!" — that's your cue
- Reply with: "You can add it yourself in 30 seconds — just upload a flyer photo here: halaqas.com/submit"
- The submit flow is itself a growth mechanism

### Track What's Working

- Monitor Cloudflare analytics (free) for traffic patterns
- Track submission sources — which mosques are getting community-submitted events?
- Note which event types are most viewed (talks, taraweeh schedules, iftars)
- Track WhatsApp share button clicks if possible

---

## Post-Ramadan Transition

### Acknowledge the Transition

- Ramadan events will naturally end. Run the auto-archive sweep
- Post a simple "Ramadan wrap-up" — thank contributors, share stats (X events listed, Y mosques covered)
- Frame ongoing value: "Halaqas continues year-round with weekly classes, regular talks, and community events"

### Retain Engaged Contributors

- Identify the 3–5 most active submitters during Ramadan
- Reach out personally to thank them and ask if they'd be willing to continue contributing (or become volunteer admins)
- These people are your most valuable asset for long-term sustainability

### Maintain Momentum

- Ensure recurring events (weekly classes, regular talks) remain listed and active
- Keep the site maintained even if traffic drops — it needs to be there and accurate when someone searches "mosque events Sydney"
- SEO will build over time — the site's long-term discoverability via Google is a slow but powerful growth channel

## Key Outreach Principles

1. **Be genuine, not salesy.** This is a community service, not a product. People can tell the difference. Share it because it's useful, not because you need downloads.

2. **Let WhatsApp do the work.** Every shared event link is free marketing. The share button is your most important growth feature.

3. **Make mosques look good.** Frame every outreach as "we're helping more people attend your events." Never position Halaqas as competing with mosques' own channels.

4. **Respect the community's time.** Keep messages short. Don't spam. Don't over-follow-up. If a mosque or community member isn't interested, move on.

5. **Be responsive.** If someone reports a bug or suggests an improvement, act fast. Early adopters who feel heard become advocates.

6. **Don't over-promise.** Launch with what works. It's better to have 20 well-maintained mosques than 200 stale listings. Quality builds trust.
